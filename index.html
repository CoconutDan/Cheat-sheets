        <!---using <img> you can post an image using html.
        img is self contained and doesn't need closing.
        in this example I would use 
        <img src="./walter-pics/walter.jpg" alt="walter is good">
        to show the image outright on the webpage. I didn't inclue it
     directly on this page because it takes up too much space.
     I don't know how to resize the image yet :(-->


    <!-- The <img> tag should contain 2 attributes
        src="[image location]"
